# Introduction

## What is Javascript?
    JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, interpreted programming language that is widely used for creating interactive and dynamic content on the web.

## Why do we need JS?
- Interactivity and Dynamic Content: JavaScript makes websites interactive (e.g., buttons, forms, animations) and allows real-time updates without reloading pages.

- Backend and Frontend Development: It works on both client-side (browsers) and server-side (Node.js), enabling seamless full-stack development.

- Cross-Platform Applications: JavaScript builds web, mobile, and desktop apps using frameworks like React, React Native, and Electron.js.

- Improved User Experience: It enhances usability with features like auto-complete, infinite scrolling, and live notifications, making websites fast and engaging.

## History of JS
    Developed by Brendan Eich in 1995. 
    
    ðŸ’¡ Pure JavaScript = vanilla JavaScript
- 1996 - Netscape 2 released JS 1.0 
- 1997 - ECMA Standard (European Computer Manufacturers Association) 
- 1997 - ES1 (ECMAScript)
- 1998 - ES2
- 1999 - ES3
- 2008 - ES4
- 2009 - ES5
- 2015 - ES6
- 2016 - ES7

- 2019 - ES10
- 2020 - ES11
- 2021 - ES12
- 2022 - ES13

## Features: 
- JS to program the behavior of Web pages.
- JavaScript is a programming language.
- JS is an OBPS (object-based Programming Language) 
    - POP: C, Pascal
    - OBPS: does not support inheritance and dynamic polymorphism, but supports dynamic memory allocation, JS
    - OOPS: required more memory, complex in configure, JAVA, .NET
- JS is an interpreted programming language, every browser has its interpreter to translate JS (just in time.)
- Browsers provide an interpreter
- that handles client-side scripting and Server-side scripting.
- supports code separation.
- JS is a case-sensitive language, that uses a Unicode character set.
- It reduces the overhead and complexity by referring to the document elements as an array.
- Prototype-based
- Multi-paradigm
- Single-threaded
- Dynamic language
- The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance

## Drawbacks Of JS: 
- Browser compatibility.
- JS code is exposed to the client from the browser, which is harmful.
- Users can block JS through the browser.
