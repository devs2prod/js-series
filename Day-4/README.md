# Datatype
    Datatype determines the type of value that can be stored in a reference
    * JS references are implicitly typed their datatype will be determined according to value.
    * JavaScript has Dynamic Types

## Primitive Datatype: Memory Allocation in Stack
    ‚Üí it is stored in the memory stack, by LIFO and created at compile time.
    ‚Üí they fixed value, and the range of value changes according to the standardization.
    ‚Üí if it is assigned to another value, then the same value will be stored.

### Number:
    - used to specify signed or unsigned integers. double (64-bit floating point)
    - All JavaScript numbers are stored as decimal numbers (floating point).
    - it can be with or without a decimal point and sometimes, an exponent number.
    - Floating point arithmetic is not always 100% accurate

    üí° NAN (Not A Number) 
        NaN is a JavaScript-reserved word indicating that a number is not a legal number. 
        NaN is a number; typeof NaN returns the number
    
    üí°Infinity 
        Infinity (or -Infinity) is the value JavaScript will return if you calculate a number outside the largest possible number
        Infinity is a number; typeof Infinity returns number.
        - Hexadecimal - starting with 0x or 0X 
        - Octal Number - starting with 0o or 0O 
        - Binary Number - starting with 0b or 0B
    
    ‚óã parseInt("Number", baseOfNumber) - to convert string(starting with number type value) to integer number. 
    ‚óã parseFloat() - to convert string(starting with number type value) to Floating number.
    ‚óã isFinite() - Determines whether the passed value is a finite number. 
    ‚óã isInteger() - Determines whether the passed value is an integer. 
    ‚óã isNaN() - Determines whether the passed value is NaN. More robust version of the original global isNaN(). 
    ‚óã isSafeInteger() - Determines whether the provided value is a number that is a safe integer.  
    ‚óã toString() - convert decimal number to numbers with base 2 to base 36. (Ex: let myNumber = 32; myNumber.toString(32) )
    
### BigInt
    ‚Üí It is used to store big integer values.
    üí° Create BigInt, Append n to the end of an integer, or call BigInt()
    ‚Üí typeof a BigInt is "bigint".
    ‚Üí All operators can be used on BigInt, except >>> (Unsigned Right Shift)
    ‚Üí BigInt can not have decimals.
    ‚Üí BigInt can also be written in hexadecimal, octal, or binary notation

### String:
    ‚Üí sequence of characters enclosed with single quotes ('), double quotes ("), or backticks (```).
    ‚Üí JavaScript counts positions from zero.
    ‚Üí single quotes must be used for substrings.
    ‚Üí JavaScript strings can have numeric content.
    ‚Üí Strings are immutable; Strings cannot be changed, only replaced.
    ‚Üí to extract characters from a string
        ‚óã charAt(*index*)
        ‚óã charCodeAt(*index*)
        ‚óã stringName[index]

| Escape sequence	| Prints  |
|-------------------|---------|
| \'                |	'  |
| \"                |	"  |
| \\                |	\  |
| \b                |	Backspace  |
| \f                |	Form Feed  |
| \n                |	New Line  |
| \r                |	Carriage Return  |
| \t                |	Horizontal Tabulator  |
| \v                |	Vertical Tabulator  |

    If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it is after an \\ operator. A safer way to break up a string, is to use string addition (+) You cannot break up a code line with a backslash.
    
    üí° Strings declared using backticks are a special kind of string called a template literal.

### Boolean:
    ‚Üí Booleans are often used in conditional testing.
    ‚Üí it stores either true or false.
    ‚Üí Everything is true
    ‚Üí Empty value is false ( 0, -0, ‚Äú ‚Äù, undefined, null, false, NaN )
    ‚Üí syntax using new Keyword

### null:
    ‚Üí it specifies that a reference is not created dynamically.
    ‚Üí keyword null is returned when a reference is not created, which is used to check true or false.
    if a value isn‚Äôt specified in any reference then it‚Äôs verified by using an empty ‚Äú ‚Äù. if a reference is not defined you can verify by using null. it is not same as NULL or Null

### undefined
    ‚Üí An empty value has nothing to do with undefined.
    ‚Üí if the value isn‚Äôt defined to any reference then it will return undefined.
    ‚Üí it is used to verify whether a value is defined for any reference.

### Symbol
    ‚Üí A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.


## Non-primitive Datatype: Memory Allocation in Heap
    ‚Üí it stores in heap memory at different locations, due to which they do not have any fixed value.
    ‚Üí the value varies according to browser memory.

### Array:
    ‚áí it reduces overhead and complexity, by storing values in sequential order. ‚áí JavaScript Array indexes are 0-based: they start at 0.
    ‚áí JS array size can be changed dynamically, they are defined by using the ‚Äú[ ]‚Äù or Array() constructor.
        Syntax: const *array_name* = [*item1*, *item2*, ...];//direct Declaration const *array_name =* new *Array(item1, item2, ...);*//using New Keyword const *array_name = Array(item1, item2, ...);*//without using New Keyword
    => by storing multiple values under the reference of a single name.
    ‚Ä¢ Const Array: Declaring array with const keyword. 
        ‚Üí Reassigning array is not allowed, but elements can be reassigned. 
        ‚Üí it must be initialized when it is declared. 
        ‚Üí An array declared in a block is not the same as an array declared outside the block
    ‚Ä¢ Sparse Array: Array with empty slots but not equivalent to slots with undefined. 
        ‚Üí In some operations, empty slots behave as if they are filled with undefined. But in others, thay are skipped.
    ‚Ä¢ Multidimensional Array: Array containing another array as a element. 
    ‚áí We can use the array to store the property like object.

    üí° const arr = Array(42); //creates an array with no elements and arr.length set to 42.
            arr["length"] == arr.length 
    => If you supply a non-integer value to the array operator, a property will be created in the object representing the array, instead of an array element.

### Object:
    Refer to the object Day.

### Regular Expression:
    syntax: /*pattern*/*modifier(s)*;
    ‚Üí it is used to validate the format of input value by using the match(reg) function, which returns Boolean true if the value matches the regular expression.
    ‚Üí it is a group of metacharacters and quantifiers enclosed in ‚Äú/ /‚Äù.

|  Meta Character |	Description  |

|  [ A-Z ]        |	only uppercase character  |

|  ( ?=*[ 0-9 ])	| at least 1 numeric character  |
|  ( ?=*[ !@#$% ])	| at least 1 special character  |
|  x(?=y)	| Matches "x" only if "x" is followed by "y".  |
|  x(?!y)	| Matches "x" only if "x" is not followed by "y".  |
|  (?<=y)x	| Matches "x" only if "x" is preceded by "y‚Äù  |
|  (?<!y)x	| Matches "x" only if "x" is not preceded by "y‚Äù  |
|  (?<name>pattern)	| named capturing group  |
|  ( )	| specific name capturing group  |

| Modifier |	Description |
|----------|----------------|code
| i |	Perform case-insensitive matching |
| g |	Perform a global match (find all matches rather than stopping after the first match) |
| m |	Perform multiline matching |
